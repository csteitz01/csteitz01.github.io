My portfolio site showing off some of the programs/webpages I have made. (For Code Louisville, my project is the unusual casino. To get to my project you clone the repo, and to just go straight to my projec, you go into the casino folder and copy the path for the index.html in that folder and paste it into your browser, or whatever method you prefer for opening an html page. One of the ways that my site is responsive I used em's for font sizes so if someone's browser is set to be a different px font size, it will scale. Also for the main casino page, when the window becomes small enough, each row has 2 games on it, and I made the working game the 1st in the list instead because it looks better. I also made the selection screen have pictures bigger when the mouse is hovering on them. An instructor pointed out that the craps game page doesn't seem to have responsive design, but the buttons are spaced further apart on mobile devices to avoid misclicks, and I don't know what else to add to that page to make it responsive. I use modal on the craps page to show the rules, and also to show if they want to leave or if they are being kicked out for not having any more money. My javascript uses jquery to make sure the user has filled out all the fields before they can play, and changes the dice on the screen according to what was rolled)
