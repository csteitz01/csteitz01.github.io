                    <h2>The Rules</h2>
                    <p>Welcome to Simplified Craps!<br>
                        The rules are as follows: You will be making
                        bets on two dice being rolled, and your
                        options for betting are called
                        Pass or Don't Pass. Pass means you are betting
                        a 7 or an 11 will be rolled first, while betting 
                        on Don't Pass means you are betting a 2, 3, or 12
                        will be rolled first. Any other numbers being rolled 
                        will result in rerolling until one of the
                        previously stated numbers are rolled. Calling the 
                        bet correctly will result in doubling your bet,
                        while calling it incorrectly will result in you losing
                        that bet. You will be asked how much money you are
                        bringing to the table, and you can't add more funds
                        once the game has started. The Quit button will make sure you want to leave and take you
                        back to the selection screen. The Roll Dice button rolls the dice,
                        and the Rules button shows this screen again if you need a refresher. </p>
