                    <h2>The Rules</h2>
                    <p>Welcome to Simplified Craps!<br>
                    The rules are as follows: You will be making
                    bets on two dice being rolled, and your
                    options for betting are called
                    Pass or Don't Pass. Pass means you are betting
                    a 7 or an 11 will be rolled first, while betting 
                    on Don't Pass means you are betting a 2, 3, or 12
                    will be rolled first. Any other numbers being rolled 
                    will result in rerolling until one of the
                    previously stated numbers are rolled. Calling the 
                    bet correctly will result in doubling your bet,
                    while calling it incorrectly will result in you losing
                    that bet. You will be asked how much money you are
                    bringing to the table, and you can't add more funds
                    once the game has started. The Quit button will tell
                    you your current bank roll, make sure you want to leave, and take you
                    back to the selection screen. The Roll Dice button rolls the dice,
                    and the Rules button shows this screen again if you need a refresher. </p>
